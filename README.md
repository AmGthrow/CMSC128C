# CMSC128C

## Setting Up
The web app can be roughly divided into two main divisons: frontend(`\client`) and backend(`server`). Frontend is for rendering HTML views and the user interface while backend handles API calls to the database.

Guides can be found for both [frontend](https://github.com/AmGthrow/CMSC128C/blob/main/client/README.md) and [backend](https://github.com/AmGthrow/CMSC128C/blob/main/server/README.md) applications
